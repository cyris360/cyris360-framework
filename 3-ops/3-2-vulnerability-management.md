### 3.2.1 Asset & Attack Surface Management
- As part of Governance section, we already mentionned that an inventory of assets & associated network interfaces, i.e. attack surface, is necessary (See section [1.1.1](../1-gov/1-1-program-and-metrics.md#111-scope--business-context)).
- The security properties (such as: confidentiality, integrity, availability) of each asset should be evaluated.
- The inventory of assets & attack surface should be maintained and enriched with relevant metadata to help analyse what interface is used with what products, and what conditions apply (authentication needed, etc).
- All relevant vendors associated with network interfaces should be documented and maintained, as well as critical recurrent activities. Think of DNS domain name or SSL certificate renewal.
- Ensure all network interfaces are scanned periodically, using the relevant security scanners: Think of SSL scanner [[8](../references.md#38-ssl-test)].
- Set up a process to centrally monitor and triage vulnerabilities from different sources, and identify the onces that needs to be addressed within specific timeframe.
- Monitor all network traffic and pattern/trends, as well as unusual behavior & error rates.

### 3.2.2 Configuration & Patch Management
- Setup a configuration management database, i.e. CMDB [[9](../references.md#39-cmdb)].
- Ensure that critical configuration parameters are protected against accidental changes.
- Ensure that all IT equipements are managed with the appropriate tool, and relevant OS & software versions are monitored using relevant EDR/UES [[10](../references.md#310-ues)].
- If you are developing software products, make sure the relevant scanner are enabled as part of the development pipeline (See section [2.2](../2-imp/2-2-product-security.md#224-secure-implementation)).

### 3.2.3 Threat Intelligence
- Make sure you subscribe to relevant national cybersecurity alerts [[11](../references.md#311-ncsc-early-warning),[12](../references.md#312-cisa-exploited-vulnerabilties)[13](../references.md#313-patch-this)].
- Set up a process to easily and quickly confirm or dismiss vulnerabilities with high risk of expolit. This may extend beyond the scope of your organization to XaaS vendors.
- If a specific vulnerability is confirmed to impact a product/service/system in scope, an incident shall be systematically triggered (See section [3.3.2](/3-3incident-management.md#332-containment-eradication--recovery)).

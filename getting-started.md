# Getting started

This guide is dedicated to target organizations who are interested in managing cyber risks efficiently. The use of CRF framework is highly customizable, and can be implemented in an incremental way. you can If you need to demonstrate to relevant stakeholders that your organization manage cyber risks in a consistent manner, there will be additional steps to do so via external (independant) party. 

## Process

1. Scope and Context
2. Gap and risk assessment
3. Management review and Action plan
4. Execution and Continual Reporting 
5. Retro and Improvements

### 1. Scope and Context 
The first step in risk assessment is to define the scope from multiple perspectives. You might take the freedom not to answer all questions, but that inevitably impact the completness of the assessment. 
- Which teams are part of the assessment ? This can be the entire organization, or it can be specifically focused on customer-facing teams.
- Which products or services are included in the assessment ? Some customers might be more interested in the security maturity of your entire organisation (people and process), while others may be more interested to have specific maturity metrics on the products or services that they are consuming. 
- How do you deliver your products and/or services to your customers ? If you deliver digital services, this may include domain name where your service is hosted, or an intermidiate party, such as an app store or a SaaS solution.
- What are the applicable regulations & standard in the operating market (industry, region, etc) ? This might include relevant regulation such as GDPR in europe, or industry specific such as KYC or PSD2 in banking industry.

The effort required for this activity can be estimated between 1 to 5 Man Days. The size of the organization usually has no direct impact on the effort needed for this step. 

### 2. Gap and risk assessment
Depending on the outcome of the the previous step, the gap assessment can be planned with internal or external parties. The main criteria for choosing who can perform a specific assessment are: Qualification and Independance. Other criteria might also influence the choice to certain degree, such as costs and trust. If the assessment if performed internally, the conflict of interest should be prevented (for example, by performing peer review). 

The assessment shall identify all (potential) gaps where risks might arise. These can be risks related to compliance, security, privacy, safety, operation, etc. specific properties can be identified to help quantify the risks more accuratly. 

Risks from former assessments, or assessment of similar organizations may be used to help identify relevant risks and likelihood of occurence. Please note that the assessment should not be perceived as one-time activity, and keep in mind that the fist iteration will strongly influence all subsequent steps. So even if the budget is limited, it is still recomended to have a comprehensive assessment.

### 3. Management review and Action plan

After gathering all relevant data about potential risks and gaps, these need to be formally reported to senior management (or management board). This is when the CISO can make a difference and real impact on the risk posture. The risks shall be associated with a brief description of recommended actions and an estimation of the associated costs. The senior management do not need to hear technical and operational details. However, they need to be able to approve an action plan that can be adjusted further if needed.

## Q&A
The following section include questions and answers related to Cyris360 Risk Framework (CRF) and cyber domain in general. 

1. How is the CRF related to other frameworks and standards such as NIST CSF and ISO 27001 ?
The CRF can be used to help you identify and choose the right solution(s) to manage the cyber risks. This may be one or a combination of multiple standards depending on your context. 
2. What are the prerequisites to start using CRF for my organization ?
The CRF is designed such that the barrier to entry is virtally non-existant. You can use it nearly for any type of organisation regardless of its industry sector, geographic location, or size. Please mind that the use of CRF is at your own risk. See [LICENSE](https://github.com/cyris360/cyris360-framework/blob/main/LICENSE) for more details.
3. What are the costs associated with the use of CRF ?
None! CRF is a community driven solution initated by Cyris360 BV to help organizations learn from each other, and improve the common knowledge around the cyber risks. Of course you still need to invest time when adopting CRF (or a custom version of it), and when you do, we encourage you to give back to the community. See details in [contributing](https://github.com/cyris360/cyris360-framework/blob/main/README.md#contributing) section.

There are two distincts domains where secure architecture applies: The infrastructure and the product. 
Depending on the target organization and the type of products delivered, these domains might partially overlap.

## Infrastructure security
Regardless of whether your infrastrcture is hosted on the cloud or on premises, there are some generic security considerations. When your infrastrure is hosted on the cloud, the shared responsability model specifies the scope of each party. 
The following activities are part of secure architecture: 
* Network Security
* Identity and Access Management (for your employees)
* Secret Management
* Vulnerabilty Management
* Patch Management 
* Logging & Monitoring 

## Product security
A product might be running entirely in your own environment (API/Online service), in an external environment (Offline mobile app) or a combination of both (Web application/Connected mobile app). In all cases, you need to adopt a secure software development lifecycle specific to your product portfolio. The main difference lies in the operation step. 
The following activities are part of product architecture: 
* Secure Design 
* Secure Implementation 
* Secure testing 
* Secure release and deployment

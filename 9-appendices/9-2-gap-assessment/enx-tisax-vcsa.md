## Instructions
This gap analysis document provides a simple framework for evaluation the current status of a Tisax VCSA. 
The status column is marked by one of the following identifiers:

* P : Pass; There are no major non-conformities and no minor non-conformities for every applicable control question for the selected audit objectives.
* CP : Conditional Pass ; Indicates one or more minor-non-conformities, but no major-non-conformities.
* F : Fail ; Indicates one or more major-non-conformities. 
The evidence shall be provided by the target user, while optional comment maybe added by the target user or the assessor.

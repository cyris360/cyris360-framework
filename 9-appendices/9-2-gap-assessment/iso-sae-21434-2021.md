## Instructions
This gap analysis document provides a simple framework for evaluation the current status of a CSMS according to ISO/SAE21434:2021 standard. 
The status column is marked by one of the following identifiers:
* V: Validated ; The associated item is compliant with the standard.
* P: Partial ; The associated item is partially compliant with the standard.
* M: Missing ; The associated item is NOT compliant with the standard.
* N/A: The associated item is not applicable.

The evidence shall be provided by the target user, while optional comment maybe added by the target user or the assessor.

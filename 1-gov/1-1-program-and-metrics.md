## 1.1.1. Scope & Business context 

**Objectives:**
* Identify all assets and associated type (Physical, Data, Intellectual property, etc.) and properties (CIA Rating, Estimated Value) 
* Identify all physical & logical interfaces that are exposed to potential threat actors.
* Identify all suppliers & services providers and associated risks based on their respective impact on the continuity of your business. 
* Identify applicable regulation depending on region & industry. For reference, here is a list of regulations that you need to consider depending on the operating region and industry sector:
  * EU Network and Information Security (NIS2)
  * US Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)
  * Financial Services (PCI DSS, PSD2)
  * Healthcare (NEN 7510, HIPAA, HITRUST CSF)
  * Automotive (UN ECE R155 & R156)
  * Privacy (GDPR-EU, CCPA-California, APA-Australia, APPI-Japan, PDPA-Singapore)
* Locate each category of assets, interface, and regulation in the known-unknown matrix. 
* Set up the appropriate process to reduce the unknown unknowns.

**Caveat**: An inventory that is filled in manually is challenging to keep up to date. Try to automate this process as much as possible.  

## 1.1.2. Risks & Objectives 

**Objectives:**
* Depending on your context & strategy, evaluate the current risks [[1](#1-nistir-8286),[2](#2-eu-rmf-enisa)]. These Risks might be related to different catgories, such as: security, privacy, safety, financial, operational, compliance, etc.
* Define a set of projects, and estimate the allocated resources (budget & staff), the required skills, an associated metric and the success criteria [[3](#3-security-okrs)].
* You can assign the projects (partially or entirely) to your existing staff. You can expand the capacity of security team by leveraging the concept of security champions [[4](#4-scsg),[5](#5-owasp-scg)].
* You can also consider outsourcing the projects (partially or entirely) [[6](#6-techtarget)].

**Hint/Caveat**: When hiring a cybersecurity professional, you can use the [[7](#7-ecsf-enisa),[8](#8-ecsf-sans)] to define the role.

## 1.1.3. Dashboard & Management review 

**Objectives:**
* Review the metrics assocaited with each objective periodically and identify potential emerging risks.
* Monitor the progress on ongoing projects and the budget spent, and estimate the Return on Security Investment (RoSI).
* Report to senior management: Discuss risk trends and the effectiveness of the current startegy.
* If needed: Consider adjusting the risk apetite and/or the objectives.

**Caveat**: Measuring the RoSI on cybersecurity projects is very challenging, and depends on a number of estimations and approxiamtions [[9](#9-rosi-enisa)].

## 1.1.1. Scope & Business context 

**Objectives:**
* Identify all assets and associated type (Physical, Data, Intellectual property, etc.) and properties (CIA Rating, Estimated Value) 
* Identify all physical & logical interfaces that are exposed to potential threat actors.
* Identify all suppliers & services providers and associated risks based on their respective impact on the continuity of your business. 
* Identify applicable regulation depending on region & industry. For reference, here is a list of regulations that you need to consider depending on the operating region and industry sector:
  * EU Network and Information Security (NIS2)
  * US Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)
  * Financial Services (PCI DSS, PSD2)
  * Healthcare (NEN 7510, HIPAA, HITRUST CSF)
  * Automotive (UN ECE R155 & R156)
  * Privacy (GDPR-EU, CCPA-California, APA-Australia, APPI-Japan, PDPA-Singapore)
* Locate each category of assets, interface, and regulation in the known-unknown matrix. 
* Set up the appropriate process to reduce the unknown unknowns.

**Rational**: This work package helps ensure the complete coverage of the scope of your cybersecurity-related responsibilities.

**Stakeholders**: Senior Management. 

**Caveat**: An inventory that is filled in manually is challenging to keep up to date. Try to automate this process as much as possible.  

## 1.1.2. Objectives & Gap assessment 

**Objectives:**
* Define the cyber risk objectives, based on your business context and strategy. These objectives might be related to security, privacy, safety, and compliance. 
* Identify the current gap for each objective, and evaluate the risk associated with each gap [[1](#1-nistir-8286),[2](#2-eu-rmf-enisa)].

**Rational**: This work package defines the actual challenge/problem that needs to be addressed. 

## 1.1.3. Roadmap & Sourcing 

**Objectives:**
* Break down the objectives into a set of projects.
* For each projects, define the required resources (budget & staff) and the success criteria.
* For each projects, identify the skills and estimated effort needed.
* Check if your existing staff has the skills, motivation and capacity to support the project execution and operation. You can expand the capacity of security team by leveraging the concept of security champions [[3](#3-scsg),[4](#4-owasp-scg)].
* Evaluate the pros and cons of insourcing and outsourcing the projects [[5](#5-techtarget)].

**Rational**: Align the expectation between the CISO and senior management. 

**Hint/Caveat**: When hiring a cybersecurity professional, you can use the [[6](#6-ecsf-enisa),[7](#7-ecsf-sans)] to define the role.

## 1.1.4. Dashboard & Management review 

**Objectives:**
* Review the risks identified in [1.1.2](#112-objectives--gap-assessment) periodically and identify potential emerging risks.
* Monitor the progress on ongoing projects and the budget spent, and estimate the Return on Security Investment (RoSI).
* Report to senior management: Discuss risk exposure & consider adjusting the risk apetite and/or the objectives.

**Rational**: Gain the trust of senior management by providing continous feedback and actionable recomendations.

**Caveat**: Measuring the RoSI on cybersecurity projects is very challenging, and depends on a number of estimations and approxiamtions [[8](#8-rosi-enisa)].

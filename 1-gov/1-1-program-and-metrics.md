## 1.1.1. Scope & business context 

**Objectives:**
* Identify all assets and associated type (Physical, Data, Intellectual property, etc.) and properties (CIA Rating, Estimated Value) 
* Identify all physical & logical interfaces that are exposed to potential threat actors.
* Identify all suppliers & services providers and associated risks based on their respective impact on the continuity of your business. 
* Identify applicable regulation depending on region & industry. 
* Locate each category of assets, interface, and regulation in the known-unknown matrix. 
* Set up the appropriate process to reduce the unknown unknowns.

**Rational**: This work package helps ensure the complete coverage of the scope of your cybersecurity-related responsibilities.

**Stakeholders**: Senior Management. 

**Caveat**: An inventory that is filled in manually is challenging to keep up to date. Try to automate this process as much as possible.  

## 1.1.2. Cybersecurity Objectives & Gap assessment 

**Objectives:**
* Define the cybersecurity objectives, based on your business context and goals.
* Identify the current gap for each objective. 
* Evaluate the risk associated with each gap [[1](#1-nistir-8286),[2](#2-eu-rmf-enisa)].

**Rational**: This work package defines the actual challenge/problem that needs to be addressed by the CISO. 

## 1.1.3. Cybersecurity Roadmap: Insourcing & Outsourcing 

**Objectives:**
* Break down the cybersecurity objectives into a set of projects.
* For each projects, define the required resources (budget & staff) and the success criteria.
* For each projects, identify the skills and estimated effort needed.
* Check if your existing staff has the skills, motivation and capacity to support the project execution and operation. 
* Evaluate the pros and cons of insourcing and outsourcing the projects [[3](#3-techtarget)].

**Rational**: Align the expectation between the CISO and senior management. 

**Hint/Caveat**: When hiring a cybersecurity professional, you can use the [[4](#4-ecsf-enisa),[5](#5-ecsf-sans)] to create the job description.

## 1.1.4. Cybersecurity Dashboard: Risk & ROSI metrics  

**Objectives:**
* Review the risks identified in [1.1.2](#112-cybersecurity-objectives--gap-assessment) regurarly and identify potential emerging risks.
* Measure the progress on ongoing projects and the budget spent, and calculate the ROSI.
* If needed: Adjust the cybersecurity objectives

**Rational**: Gain the trust of senior management by providing continous feedback and actionable recomendations.

**Caveat**: Measuring the ROSI on cybersecurity projects is very challenging, and depends on a number of estomations and approxiamtions [[6](#6-rosi-enisa)].
